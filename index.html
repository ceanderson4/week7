<p>What did you think?</p>
<p>Story maps are an interesting way to tell a tale, if you have a story to tell. I struggled to determine the story I wanted to share. I had a few ideas, especially with the group project hazard data, but it wasn't coming out correctly.</p>
<p>I finally decided to see how a story map could work as a business pitch. My cousins are attempting to start a brewery and I decided to share their story. I really enjoyed using odyssey from cartdb as it was simple to use.</p>
<p>The thing I liked least about odyssey.js was despite using markdown (which made things incredibly easy), the formatting for positioning of photos and text was not straightforward. Regardless, I would use this again for a quick project.</p>
